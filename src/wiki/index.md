## Topics
This wiki aims to cover a vast majority of technical subjects that come up in cybersecurity. Most content is meant for capture the flag competetions and the US CyberPatriot competetion. Occasionally, there may be answers to commonly asked questions that are highly relevant to computers (ex. what is a file extension, how do phishing attacks work, how much harm can a website do to my computer).
