# About the site
This functions as a sort of hybrid between a blog and a wiki. When stuff I write makes sense as a knowledge graph I add it to the wiki. The blog is more likely to contain specific posts, while the wiki will be more vague. The idea is I should be able to send someone a page from the wiki for certain concepts and they should be able to understand it easily. If they don't they should be able to click on the links referenced in the wiki page.
## Software
I recommend using Obsidian or Foam for VSCode. They make dealing with huge markdown collections a lot nicer here.
